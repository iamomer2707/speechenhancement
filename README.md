# Speech Enhancement 🎙️✨

Welcome to **Speech Enhancement** – a project where I experiment with deep learning to make noisy speech sound clearer and more natural. The goal is simple: take messy, noisy audio and turn it into something you’d actually want to listen to.  

I’ve built this using neural networks with **residual connections**, which basically help the model learn better without losing important details from the speech signal. Think of it like noise-canceling headphones, but powered by AI.

## 🚀 What this project does

- Cleans up noisy speech audio  
- Tries to preserve the “naturalness” of a person’s voice  
- Uses residual network connections so the model learns deeper and faster  
- Easy to extend and play around with if you want to tweak the models
