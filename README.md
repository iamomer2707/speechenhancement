# Speech Enhancement 🎙️✨

Welcome to **Speech Enhancement** – a project where I experiment with deep learning to make noisy speech sound clearer and more natural. The goal is simple: take messy, noisy audio and turn it into something you’d actually want to listen to.  

I’ve built this using neural networks with **residual connections**, which basically help the model learn better without losing important details from the speech signal. Think of it like noise-canceling headphones, but powered by AI.

## 🚀 What this project does

- Cleans up noisy speech audio  
- Tries to preserve the “naturalness” of a person’s voice  
- Uses residual network connections so the model learns deeper and faster  
- Easy to extend and play around with if you want to tweak the models

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Clone the repo and set things up:

git clone https://github.com/iamomer2707/speechenhancement.git
cd speechenhancement

---

## Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirement.txt

---

## ▶️ How to use

Here’s a simple way you could run the enhancement (adjust depending on your setup):

python manage.py enhance --input noisy_audio.wav --output clean_audio.wav

This will take in a noisy file and (hopefully) give you back a cleaner version.
Note: Command may vary depending on how you set it up — feel free to tweak.

## 💡 Why I built this

I’ve always been fascinated by how deep learning can improve audio. Noisy Zoom calls, poor recordings, or just background sounds — we all deal with them. This project is my way of exploring how AI can make our voices clearer and communication smoother.
